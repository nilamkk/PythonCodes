We have a "database.csv" file.

Task:

Create 2 new columns in this database file, names should be "NumericFound", "numbers"

Subtasks:

1. If any digits (0 to 9) found in any email, extract that number and copy that into the "numbers" column else fill that row with NA
2. If any digit found in any email id just label it as "1" else "0" in "NumericFound" column.

Hint:
Use regex and pandas.

Check Example_Output.csv file for reference.
