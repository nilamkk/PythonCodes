We have a database called "student_scores.csv", in column "marks" you can see actual marks of the students, standardize the results as per the below guidelines. Standard tags should be filled in "tag" column (you need to create a new column named as "tag" in "student_scores.csv" file)

1. If student marks are >85 , then tag that student as "merit"
2. If student marks are >78 or <85, then tag that student as "passed"
3. If student marks are <78 then tag that student as "failed"

Example:

In a row user x got 75 marks, in "tag" column of that row, mark that user as "failed".

Hint:

Use pandas with python to do this.

Check Example_Output.csv file for reference.
